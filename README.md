#Work with Dynamic Loops like a boss - Client-side 
As a front end developer i work with code all the time and what i face a lot is when the developer provide me a loop of DOM elements with Dynamic IDs <br>And i want to make something simple like on click i expand a specific (div) for example.<br>From here i got the idea for using something more flexible like Attributes so simple and will work with almost anything and so flixeble as well
